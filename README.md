# System Architecture
- The Payment Processing Application follows clean architecture principles with a feature-first organization approach. This design ensures separation of concerns while maintaining a modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# High-Level Architecture
- The application implements a three-layer architecture pattern:
Presentation Layer: Contains UI components, views, and view models/controllers.
Domain Layer: Contains business logic, use cases, and entities.
Data Layer: Handles data operations through repositories and data sources.

Sources: Repository structure inferred from application organization.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature Organization
- The codebase is organized by features rather than by technical layers:
Each feature (Authentication, Checkout, Payment, Product) contains its own implementation of the three architecture layers, providing a self-contained module.

#Repository Structure

- The repository follows a feature-first structure with the following organization:

lib/
├── Features/
│   ├── checkout/
│   │   ├── presentation/
│   │   │   ├── view/
│   │   │   │   └── mycart_view.dart
│   │   │   └── view_model/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   │   ├── entities/
│   │   │   ├── repositories/
│   │   │   └── use_cases/
│   │   └── data/
│   │       ├── data_sources/
│   │       └── repositories/
│   ├── authentication/
│   ├── payment/
│   └── products/
├── Core/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── constants/
│   └── widgets/
└── main.dart

This structure demonstrates how the application organizes code by feature rather than by layer, supporting the clean architecture implementation.

#Conclusion
-The Payment Processing Application provides a comprehensive solution for e-commerce transactions using Flutter. Its clean architecture ensures separation of concerns, while the feature-first organization facilitates focused development. The checkout feature, particularly the MyCartView component, plays a crucial role in the user journey from product selection to payment completion.
